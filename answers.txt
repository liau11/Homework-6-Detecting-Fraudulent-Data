Answer to Problem 7:

2009 Iranian election MSE: 0.0007395833333333335
Quantity of MSEs larger than or equal to the 2009 Iranian election MSE: 435
Quantity of MSEs smaller than the 2009 Iranian election MSE: 9565
2009 Iranian election null hypothesis rejection level p: 0.0435

The p-value is 0.0435, which means about 4.35% of genuine elections were as 
different from the uniform distrution as the Iran election was. This means
that we can reject the Null Hypothesis because the p-value is less than 0.05,
meaning there is statistical difference. We are 95.65% confident that the 
data was fradulent. 

Answer to Problem 8:

2008 United States election MSE: 0.0001410025876058068
Quantity of MSEs larger than or equal to the 2008 United States election MSE: 5245
Quantity of MSEs smaller than the 2008 United States election MSE: 4755
2008 United States election null hypothesis rejection level p: 0.5245

The p-value is 0.5245, which means about 52.45% of genuine elections were as 
different from the uniform distrution as the US election was. This provides
no evidence regarding the null hypothesis.

Collaboration:

None.
